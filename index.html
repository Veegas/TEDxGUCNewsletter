Being that, such an event’s magnitude is one with much needed preparation; thus a TEDucation was delivered by the Associates’ Education team to ensure that the vibrant mentalities of each associate within the team do not strand off and lose focus within the process The theme generation process was mainly based on TED’s actual methodology of creating a theme which could be viewed on their website.<br><br>The organization was divided into 8 groups each discussing different ideas, topics and answering different questions which include the following: What is your vision for TEDxGUC’s main event, How technology could be Egypt's hope for a better future, What is self-expression for you, State a cultural problem in Egypt and how TEDxGUC could contribute towards solving it, Prepare a 45 seconds pitch to explain ted to a person who is confused with the misconception, If you would list 3 topics under technology, entertainment and design. What would they be, Describe a person who is a member in our community and finally, topics/ideas that reflects our community outward to the world.<br><br>After answering each of the following questions or completing the incomplete statements, the teams were grouped and started to combine, collect and come up with different ideas and words that described each of the ideas or feelings that the associates felt were appropriate to describe a situation. Then, all the words that were proposed by each group were set up for a vote and after a long, hectic and eye opening day with many mentality perspectives being brought into light, Cascade became this year’s theme.</h6></div></div></div><div class="team team__body slide" data-anchor="Boomerang"><div class="team__body__container"><h4 class="team__body__title">Boomerang</h4><div class="team__body__content-container"><h6 class="font_content flow-text">Boomerang was a day organized by Experience Management with a main objective of feedback. Feedback was created on that premise but given the negative connotations that have been affiliated with it, it has been disregarded by many and the power of it has been neglected. However, Experience Management designed the boomerang day in a sense where feedback or 360 feedback actually to be a channel of communication between the associate and the organization in order to ensure the full experience of the associate and to maximize the output of the organization as a whole.<br><br>Starting off the day, Experience Management Executive, Hossam Thabet, explained basically how the day is going to go and what’s the importance of the day. Then the teams were divided into different slots and each of the team werent taking part in the feedback sessions were simultaneously taking part in a series of activities laid out by the Experience Management team.<br><br>The feedback was mainly divided into different sections; executive, team, workload and organizational. Each team was given the opportunity to take part in the feedback session and explain their point of view on every topic. The results were highly beneficial altering any negatively perceived situations to the better.<br><br>Simultaneously, the teams that weren’t in feedback sessions were taking part in activities. Starting off with the lip syncing battle between individuals and then teams as a whole. Then there was the food contest in which each associate had to spin a wheel for a base such as chips or yogurt, and another wheel for the topping such as milk or hot sauce. After that, each associate had to eat their plate and the one that finishes first wins. At the end of the day, we recollected and headed off to Eatery for a dinner after a long exciting yet beneficial day.</h6></div></div></div><div class="team team__body slide" data-anchor="Salon event"><div class="team__body__container"><h4 class="team__body__title">Salon event</h4><div class="team__body__content-container"><h6 class="font_content flow-text">The salon working circle was composed of 39 associates along with the ten executives and Basel, curator of finance.

A workshop that discussed problems we face in our local community and their solutions lead to the theme “Parasite”.<br><br>Prior to the first meeting, Research and Coaching compiled two live speakers: Marwa Atef and her talk was titled 'Mutual benefit between Big Corporates and SMEs', and Dalia Soliman, who talked about 'Dealing with People who Suffer from Autism'. They were coached by members of coaching from outside the circle.<br><br>Meetings with the Talks division were also held to choose two screened talks that would be appropriate and related to the theme which were: 1) What I Learned as Kid in Jail by Ismail Nazario and 2) Zombie Roaches and Other Tales of Parasites by Ed Yong. Design associates then generated the visual theme with a specific style of typography and visual elements that exemplify the theme.<br><br>As for PR team, they chose Ahmed Sameh, founder of Emmkan, to be the host for the day.<br><br>Talks division then planed the discussions that would be conducted about both screened talks.
